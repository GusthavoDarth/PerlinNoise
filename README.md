# Perlin Noise

## Goal
my goal with this proejct was make a simple Perlin Noise generator using only C and Raylib to do the graphics

## How to use the program
When you start the program, it already shows a Perlin Noise grid, and you can create a new one just by pressing the space key.
Also, you can press both Up and Down arrow keys to increase or decrease the resolution of the Perlin Noise.
I have added a second mode to see the Pelin Noise. Just press 1 or 2 to alternate between the two.
