# Perlin Noise
I built a procedural terrain generation tool using Perlin noise algorithms, which is a core technique used in game development (e.g., Minecraft) and graphics to create natural-looking landscapes. This project demonstrates my understanding of complex algorithms, interpolation, and visual output programming.

## How to use the program
When you start the program, it already shows a Perlin Noise grid, and you can create a new one just by pressing the space key.
Also, you can press both Up and Down arrow keys to increase or decrease the resolution of the Perlin Noise.
I have added a second mode to see the Pelin Noise. Just press 1 or 2 to alternate between the two.
